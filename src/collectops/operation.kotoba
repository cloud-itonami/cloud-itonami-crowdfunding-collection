  "OperationActor — one collection request = one supervised actor run,
  expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The advisor (CollectionAdvisor)
  is sealed into a single node (:advise); its proposal is ALWAYS routed
  through the CollectionGovernor (:govern) and the rollout phase gate
  (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore today)   - `store` arg
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)  - :advisor opt
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)     - :phase in ctx

  One graph run = one collection request (intake -> advise -> govern ->
  decide -> commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner loop — each
  operation is auditable and checkpointed.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow: `interrupt-before
  #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the decision to a human
  finance reviewer. The approver resumes with
  `{:approval {:status :approved :by \"..\"}}` (or :rejected).

  Because `:plan-collection` and `:finalize-collection` always escalate
  (governor AND phase, independently), the ONLY path by which backers are
  debited — and the ONLY path by which a campaign declares what it
  actually received — runs through this interrupt. A named human is
  structurally unavoidable on both, which is the point: those are the two
  moments that decide whether money moves and what everyone downstream
  believes about it."
